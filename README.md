PS4 raiders reputation automation: Sore fingers? Use PS4 Remote Play + attached scripts for PS4 Macro to get max rep with no effort!
Some time ago I did a vid (with English subtitles) on how to use PS4 Macro to automate crafting and get unlimited screws:

You can use PS4 Macro to also automate glitch with Rocksy or Meg and save yourself hours of manually going through the dialogs and risking making a mistake.
Steps:
You need PS4 Remote Play from Sony: 
https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/lang/en/index.html
Start it, open Fallout 76, stand in front of Meg or Rocksy the way you'd normally do the glitch. Deamon has vids on how to the glitch manually.
Get PS4 Macro and run it: https://github.com/komefai/PS4Macro/releases/download/v0.5.2/PS4Macro_0_5_2.zip
If you have problems check my previous vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FkPyj7TQVA&t=27s)
Get scripts for the quests and unpack them:
https://github.com/fala13/PS4MacroScripts/archive/master.zip
In PS4 Macro press File > Open and select rocksy.xml or meg_long.xml or meg_short_buggy.xml (3x fasters but sometimes breaks and need to rejoin server) and press play.
Go watch Too Hot to Handle or Tiger King on Netflix and from time to time take a look if the script is running allright or you didn't starve to death in game. In case of any issues stop the script, reposition yourself in front of Meg/Rocksy and start it again. With Meg sometimes you might need to rejoin server to trigger it again. Best not to do anything on the PC this is running, because the process can get interrupted by some lags as we're simulating controller presses over network.
I recommend doing the Rocksy quest, because the dialog is shorter but if you have it on cooldown and then try Meg (if you didn't complete the quest). There is a chance they will patch both soon, so get your rep up while you can!
